=== Woofy 1.0 Alpha ===

WARNING: this is for all intents and purposes an alpha version, with bugs and crashes and all that. 
If you encounter any of these, please raise an issue at http://code.google.com/p/woofy/issues/list - 
I will try to get them fixed before the final release.

WARNING 2: Woofy 1.0 uses a completely rewritten download engine, one that allows definition creators
to go wild and implement some pretty cool stuff in their definitions. However, in this Alpha version, 
definition creators can also make a definition do a lot of evil stuff to your computer. 
The final version will address this, but until then only use definitions from reliable sources.

==== Features ====

* A completely rewritten download engine.
* An improved user interface, with more information about the download process.
* Downloads comics from start to finish, and not backwards.
* After each download Woofy pauses for 2 seconds, in order to minimize server hammering.
* The settings files are stored under each user's profile - should fix some issues with Windows 7/Vista.
* Removed the proxy settings, Woofy will use whatever proxy has been set for Internet Explorer.
* Added one (that's right, ONE) new comic - Snowflakes.
