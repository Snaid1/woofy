=== Woofy 1.1 Beta ===

WARNING: Woofy 1.x uses a completely rewritten download engine, one that allows definition creators
to go wild and implement some pretty cool stuff in their definitions. However, in this Beta version
definition creators can also make a definition do a lot of evil stuff to your computer. 
The final version will address this, but until then only use definitions from reliable sources.

==== Features ====
