- ask for every supported comic's permision to be included in Woofy
- replace SQLite with xml/json
- support multiple definition formats -> by default they should be written using json, as it is easier to read and harder to mess-up than xml.
- the user settings/tasks db should be stored under Local Settings
- an option whether to install in portable-mode - without writing anything to the registry, and keeping the settings/comics in the same directory
- the default download directory should be under My Documents
- 3 simple proxy settings: none, auto-detect, explicit proxy (by default it should autodetect)
- more specific error messages -> must be able to copy them to clipboard
- display favicons for the comics
- simplify auto-update code
- simplify user-settings code
- auto-update should no longer run the installer => instead, the zip version should be downloaded and unpacked.
- set a meaningful user-agent
