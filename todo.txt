** current
- The debug logger should also contain a RollingFileAppender.
- The auto-update code has troubles interpreting the release date.
- Errors should be logged in the Event Log.


** later

- ask for every supported comic's permision to be included in Woofy
- support multiple definition formats -> by default they should be written using json, as it is easier to read and harder to mess-up than xml.
- 3 simple proxy settings: none, auto-detect, explicit proxy (by default it should autodetect)
- more specific error messages 
	-> must be able to copy them to clipboard
	-> or publish somewhere the debug log (thus avoiding the need for a definitions debugger).
- display favicons for the comics
- simplify auto-update code
- auto-update should no longer run the installer => instead, the zip version should be downloaded and unpacked.
- Woofy should not close when CloseWhenAllComicsHaveBeenDownloaded is true and at least one comic has an error.
- the user settings/tasks db should be stored under Local Settings
- an option whether to install in portable-mode 
	- without writing anything to the registry,
	- and keeping the settings
	- and comics in the same directory
- add an option to copy a comic's error message to clipboard
- add an option to resume a stopped comic.
