=== Woofy ===

Woofy is a pretty neat webcomic downloader, designed for simplicity and extensibility. Its purpose is to help you download and maintain an archive of your favorite online comics, while not getting too much in your way.

Also, due to the fact that it uses comic definition files for downloading the comics, it can easily be extended to support new comics.

==== Features ====

* A completely rewritten download engine.
* An improved user interface, with more information about the download process.
* Downloads comics from start to finish, and not backwards.
* Can embed additional metadata such as the title and description inside each downloaded strip (the metadata can be viewed using any image viewer that supports the XMP standard, such as XnView MP or Zoner Photo Studio)
* The settings files are stored under each user's profile - should fix some issues with Windows 7/Vista.
* Woofy can now be installed in portable mode
